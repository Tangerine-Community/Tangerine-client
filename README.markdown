# Assess students with tablets or your phone

Tangerine is an application for assessing students on any scale, country-level, district-level or classroom-level.
Tangerine is designed for [Early Grade Reading Assessments](https://www.eddataglobal.org/reading/) but flexible and powerful enough to handle any survey's requirements.

Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/wiki) for the most up to date development guides
and references and [Tangerine Central](http://www.tanerinecentral.org) for much more information and news.

Alternatively put, Tangerine is a [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org/page/index) that uses
[Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [LessCSS](http://lesscss.org/) written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) augmented with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and PHP.

# Getting Started

_The following is a list of tools useful for Tangerine. Related: See the guide for setting up a
[Tangerine server](https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine/wiki/Tangerine-Server).

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[Bower](http://bower.io)

Then clone this repo.

    git clone https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine-client.git
	
Use the correct branch - for stable development, stick to master. For recent development, use develop

## Init the source code

    npm install
    bower install

These commands read the relevant node and ruby dependencies and installs all of the necessary libraries.

There's a postinstall script that runs when npm install is done that will add the android platform and then run gulp init.

## Start the app

To launch the app, run the npm start target, which uses the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
and runs ./scripts/listen.rb to compile changed coffeescript files and other useful tasks.

    npm start

## View the app

To view the app with minimised javascript, open http://localhost:8080

Sourcemaps are now available; therefore, you should be able to debug with them.

## Generate an APK

    npm build:apk

## Other useful targets

View package.json for other useful npm targets:

 - npm listen turns on the changes listener and compiles coffeescript files.
 - npm run build:apk will generate a debug APK.
 - npm test will run mocha-phantomjs tests and watch for changes to coffeescript files.
 - npm run-script testW will run tests using mocha-phantomjs, displaying output on command line and watch for changes to coffeescript files.
 - npm run-script testInBrowser will run mocha tests in the browser at http://localhost:9000/test/
 - npm run debug will copy files into www/compiled and build index-dev.html. Use this when using chrome debugger until gulp 
   handles sourcemaps better (https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/issues/105). It's a little wonky; it may fail the first time it is run. Try again.
   
# Bootstrapping

Preload.js in the scripts dir will download assessments. Enter the username and password on the commandline:

    preload.js T_ADMIN=user T_PASS=pass
    
# Resolving issues

Fork the repository and update your fork

    git remote show Tangerine-Community
    git checkout master
    git pull Tangerine-Community master

Get the id of the issue youâ€™re fixing

    git checkout -b iss85

Fix the bug and commit the change. Submit a pull request.
    
# Clearing your pouch instance

Sometimes you need to start with a fresh pouch. Paste this to your javascript console and it will delete your tangerine pouch.

    var db = new PouchDB('tangerine');
      db.destroy().then(function () {
        // success
      }).catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error);
      });

# Testing

The tests run in mocha/phantomjs. The pouch runs in a in-memory container.

# Dependencies

Using http://greenkeeper.io/ to manage dependencies.

# Tangerine API

Tangerine.progress is an object that contains status of the application: index, currentView, etc.
